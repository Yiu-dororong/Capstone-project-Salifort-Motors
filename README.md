# Capstone project: Salifort Motors

This is the capstone project of my Google advanced data analytics course. I want to leave my work here to present my understanding and idea. Unlike the previous one (Waze's study), I completed this one with very little guidance. Therefore, I am glad to share my thought here.

As usual, I will leave the full code notebook [here]().

# Situation

The HR department at Salifort Motors wants to take some initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company. They collected data from employees, and they referred to me as a data analytics professional and ask you to provide data-driven suggestions based on my understanding of the data. They have the following question: whatâ€™s likely to make the employee leave the company?

The goals in this project are to analyze the data collected by the HR department and to **build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company.**

If the model can predict employees likely to quit, it might be possible to identify factors that contribute to their leaving. Because it is time-consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be beneficial to the company.
